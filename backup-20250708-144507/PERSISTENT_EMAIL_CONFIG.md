# Persistent Email Configuration

This survey application now includes persistent email configuration storage to retain email settings across server restarts.

## How It Works

### Automatic Configuration Persistence
- Email settings are automatically saved to `email-config.json` when configured through the admin panel
- Configuration is loaded automatically when the server starts
- No manual intervention required for normal operation

### Configuration File Location
- **File**: `email-config.json` (in the project root directory)
- **Security**: This file is automatically added to `.gitignore` to prevent credentials from being committed to version control

### Server Startup Behavior
1. **With Existing Config**: Server loads saved email settings and displays "Email configuration loaded from file"
2. **Without Config**: Server uses default empty configuration and displays "Using default email configuration"

## API Endpoints

### Get Configuration Status
```
GET /api/email-config-status
```
Returns current email configuration status including:
- Whether email is configured
- SMTP server details (without password)
- Configuration file existence

### Configure Email (Enhanced)
```
POST /api/configure-email
```
Now automatically saves configuration to disk with enhanced response messages.

## Benefits

✅ **No Reconfiguration**: Email settings persist across server restarts
✅ **Security**: Credentials are stored locally and excluded from version control
✅ **Reliability**: Automatic loading ensures consistent email functionality
✅ **Transparency**: Clear console messages indicate configuration status

## File Structure

The `email-config.json` file contains:
```json
{
  "host": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "port": 587,
  "secure": false,
  "auth": {
    "user": "your-email@gmail.com",
    "pass": "your-app-password"
  }
}
```

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: The `email-config.json` file contains sensitive credentials and should:
- Never be committed to version control (automatically prevented by `.gitignore`)
- Be backed up securely if needed
- Have appropriate file permissions in production environments

## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Not Loading
1. Check if `email-config.json` exists in the project root
2. Verify the JSON format is valid
3. Check server console for error messages

### Reset Configuration
To reset email configuration:
1. Stop the server
2. Delete `email-config.json`
3. Restart the server
4. Reconfigure through the admin panel

## Production Deployment

For production environments, consider:
- Using environment variables for additional security
- Implementing database storage for multi-instance deployments
- Setting up proper file permissions for the configuration file
- Regular backup of configuration files
